If you are reading this, the new site is online. It turned from a "Game Dev Portfolio" Site into a "Content Dump and Protfolio" Site, using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) Static Site Generator.

## But whyyyyyy?

Because it's interesting to try out new stuff. It's faster to put new content here, and now it is more up to date again.

Also, this site gets like ten clicks per month so it doesn't matter anyways xd

## How to get along

Check out the "Games" and "Tools" items in the header. They contain all the contain plus some more of what the previous version had.

There's also a RSS feed now, so it's easier to know when something gets added here.
